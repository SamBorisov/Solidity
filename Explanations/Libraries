Libraries and how to use them

- Tokens:
  - ERC20 - Normal token that's tradable, not unique
  - ERC721 - Special token that's tradable, unique (NFT)
  - ERC1155 - Special token that's tradable, could have copies (fungible)

  - ERC20PresetMinterPauser - burnable, mintable, pausable token ERC20

 - SafeMath - To prevent overflows and underflows using this library
 - TransferHelper - To make sure your transfer was executed correctly
Secure double-spending, attacks, does not return bool false when a transaction fails 

 - AccessControl - for setting up roles for users and giving them control over specific functions
 - Ownable - for having an owner of the contract who is the deployer

 - EIP712 - using a domain separator, name, version, chain ID, and address of the contract
The main goal of EIP-712 is to ensure that both the message sender and the message receiver interpret the data in the same way. 
It defines a standard way to structure, encode, and hash data before it is signed, ensuring consistency across different implementations.

 - ECDSA - used to verify signatures, recover a signer from a signature, and more
