:
We can log things with custom error (msg sender…)
Assert (num == 123) (if not it will revert) 
If function returns multiple things we can capture them with:
(uint x, bool b) = returnMany()
(, bool b) = returnMany() // If we don’t need the 1st one (still need the comma)
CREATE2 - able to predict contract address

^Array- when you delete element the length if the array stays the same and the element is 0, 
If you want to remove it from the array you need to shift all other elements to the left from it and them pop the last element, 
another gas efficient  way is to just replace the last element this this one and then pop (but it does not safe the order) 

^we can make test function and check after every action with assert! 

^ Mapping - we can delete elements (when we delete it is resented to default value)
If we want to interact with all of the mappings, we need array to save them and another mapping bool to keep in track if they are already in the array!

^delete struct is reseting it’s values	(or value we chose)
When interaction with storage keywords it changes the value of the structure 

^ delete enum is resting to the 1st item of the enum, we can set statuses by giving number from 0 to n and change the enum.

^Storage - modify blockchain

^Memory - store until function ends 

^Calldata - store as read-only (not modifiable) until function end (gas efficient)

^If we access the an array and need to modify a lot of times it’s better to make a storage reference and to update the reference, but if we do it only 1-2 times it’s better to do it directly

^ view function safe more gas declared as Storage , cuz they don’t make copy

^events even if they don’t change anything inside the contract they put information into the blockchain and a function with event is transactional

^Order of inheritance - from most vase-like to derived

^Constructors cannot be calldata

^Inheritance - is A, B , constructor(_txtB, _txtA) B(‘asfnsaf’) A(‘kdjfkdf’), it will be executed always as how it is inherently, no matter order of the constructor 

^ when using ‘super’ keyword for parents it will call all parents if we have more then once

^ when overriding a function, we can still call this function inside as the original logic

^we can call external functions with ‘this.functionName’ but it costs a lot of gas!

^receive - is executed when data is empty , if we have data the fallback will be executed , if we have both payable 
Receive does not trigger with data and should be always payable
Fallback triggers only with data ( if we put data and ETH, but is is not payable , I will get an error) , but only with data works if not payable
Both are only able to be external 

^sent ETH - contract can receive from constructor payable or receive/fallback function, or payable function overall
Give ETH from contract - 
1 - _to.trasnfer(_value) - revert if it fails
2 - _to.send(value) - returns a bool if it went or not, we can do it like this to ensure:
bool sent = _to.send(_value);
require(sent, ”send failed”);
3 - sents all the gas (unlike others who send 2300 both)
(bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _value}(“”);
require(success, ”call failed”);

^Delegate Calls - When you perform a delegate call in Solidity, you're essentially executing code from another contract as if it were a part of the calling contract. This means that the code being executed has access to the state variables and storage of the calling contract.

^When using Library we can say - using Lib for uint, and then call nameUnti.funcLub

^abi.ecnode - makes data into bytes
Abi.encodePacked - make to bytes and compresses data: If we have 2 strings , 1st ends with ‘a’ and use again same function but delete the ‘a’ from the 1st and add a in front of the 2nd, it will create the same output (hash problem), arrange so no dynamic inputs are next to eachother (string to string / uint to uint…)

^Recover - sign msg -> hash msg, getEthSignedMessageHash, recover (with address, sig, EthSignedMsgHash, split the sign r s v (assembly) 

^selfDestruct sends forced ETH to another contract (no receive function)

^Data return (msg.data) -  1st 4 bytes 0x12345678 - name of the function made by:
bytes4(keccack256(bytes(_func)));
Then rest of the data is the passed parameters 
^we can create a custom simple Interface with only the function with need (for example if we need only trasnferFrom, we can create interface with only this function)

^Create 2 , add salt bytes - new Contract {salt: bytes32(_salt)}
^to get the address:
Bytes32 hash = kecack256(abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0xff), address(this), _salt , keccack256(bytecode)
Return address(uint160(uint(hash)));

^MultiCall - we can call multiple functions  from other contracts , by knowing the address and the data of the function (encodeWithSelector) / encodeWithSignature
^DelegateMutiCall - if we use msg.sender with normal multi call it will take the address of contract not user. (Needs the contract of Deletacall to me inported in the contract in functions)
Dangerous - if we use parameter like msg.value and we use mutiDelegateCall and type the input of a function multiple times, it will use the msg.value for the 3 functions and give triple rewards.

^Gas Golf - use calldata
- Load state variable in memory (if we call it multiple times) directly talking with state variables is expensive 
- short circuit - to make if (false) -> to not do other code, if we have more the one thing to check ,to not calculate all then check, but then the 1st one is false others to be ignored 
- loop increment - ++i is better than  i += i ;
- Cashing the lengths of state variable: uint len = nums.lenght; (not use num.lenght every time in a loop and load it)
- Load array elements - uint num = num[i], then use num in the if statement 

^AMM - demand supply - liquidity pools give tokens and the price of the mutilation of the tokens should be a constant x * y = k, each time there is a token that people by more of , it will cost more ‘other’ tokens to buy.
AMM Swap tokens - dy = YdX / x + dx

^We don’t need to declare variable if it is in the function as returns(…)

^BitWise Operators with numbers
- and = x & y
- Or = x  | y
- Xor = x ^ y
- Not = ~x (use uint8 for small operations)
- ShiftLeft = x << bits
- ShiftRight = x >> bits
- Get last N bits = x % (1 << n);

^Encode data:
- abi.encodeWithSingnature(“trasfer(address,uint256)”, to amount);
Make sure that there are no extra spaces or anything to the function uint256, not only uint.  If we make type the code will still compile.
- Abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to , amount)
With encode selector if we have a typo it won’t compile, but if we give wrong inputs of the function or missing inputs, it will compile, we can pass the wrong datatype.
- Abi.encodeCall(IERC20.transfer, (to, amount))
Using call , check both function name and inputs lengths, type
!!!All this encoding Returns the same data!

- Test Function - 
Function test (address _contract, bytes calldata data) external {
	(bool ok,) = _contract.call(data);
	require(ok, “call failed”);
This function is to call the function we encoded with the data and address of the contract we wanna call!

^Swot storage:
We can also save a var to a specific slot by:
Bytes32 public constant VAR_SLOT = bytes32(
	uint(keccack256(“eip1967.proxy.implementation”)) - 1 );
(Minus one to be be difficult to predict the hash)
All functions / variables should be private, forward all calls to fallback
We need to write get function to get the item for the storage
When me make modifiers and check something in that storage it should be handled with view function

^Check if address is contract
requite(address.code.length >0 ,”not a contract”);

^Fallbacks: 
in 0.8 fallbacks can take inputs as bytes and return outputs as bytes
We can create  proxy without assembly 
But we can still cannot return data with receive function!
^.selector - gives the 1st 4 bytes that define the function name, it will not give anything if function is internal or private 
^slots - a slot for storage can hold up to 32 bytes, if we use unit256, we can see how may bytes it is by simply dividing 256/8 and we will get 32. 
So if we make a structure that has: bytes8 (we do not divide), unit 160 (160/8) , bool (1 byte) …. And the sum is 32 or less, then it works for slot one structure in storage!
^Bytes does not have default like uint = uint256, it is dynamic sized bytes array
We can out code in the function from modifier between lines
^Epoch root - like unique hash for epoch

^try {} catch {} - to catch errors in the code
It does not revert the transaction, but it will catch the error and continue the code.
If we want to revert we need to do it manually.
It is good for external calls, if we want to catch the error and continue the code, and not to revert the transaction.
If the gas is not enough for the call in the try block it won't catch the error, but it will revert the transaction.

////////// Transient stage ///////////
Data is cleared only after a transaction (not after a function like memory)
Using assembly we can sore in a slot and tstore(SLOT, data)
It is used to save gas
