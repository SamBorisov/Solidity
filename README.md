Address: Every account and smart contract has an address. It is used to send and receive Ether from one account to another. You can consider it your public identity on the Blockchain.

Mapping: Data type used to store associations. Similar to a list but holding 2 values, and allow you to quickly get the value corresponding to a key.

Event: When you call an event, it causes the arguments to be stored in transaction's log.
Emit: keyword used to call Events 

Constructor: function that is run directly when the contract is created or deplyed in the the blockchain/it can be run once and only once

msg: keyword that allows us to access some special variables that are available for us from the blockchain.

Require: Convenience function in solidity. It guarantees validity of conditions that cannot be detected before execution.

Constant: keyword added to a variable that tells solidity it cannot be changed

struct: Struct types are used to represent a record. That allow you to create your own data type.

enum: Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.

arrey: player[] public players;

modifier: can be used to chnage the behaviour of functions in a declarative way. For example you can used a modifier to automatically check a condition prios to exectuing the function.

msg.sender: The user that calls this function

super: keyword to add other constructor modifiers you shoud add in the function

msg.sender: the person who call the function

msg.value: if it's payable the eather it sender 1e18 or 1000000...

now: timestamp for the curroent time

indexed: The indexed parameters for logged events will allow you to search for these events using the indexed parameters as filters.

public - all can access

external - Cannot be accessed internally, only externally

internal - only this contract and contracts deriving from it can access

private - can be accessed only from this contract - default variables (all data on blockchain is public so it's not so private)
You either donâ€™t put private data on the blockchain, or you put hashes.

                                           Interview

Etherum smart contract is small program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain
Once it is deplyed it cannot be stopped / hacked (as long as the code of the contract is correct) or be changed (the code is immutable , however the data is)
Smart contracts can interact with echother , however they can't call an API(Application Programming Interface) on the web!
Smart contract store limited data , string data cost gas.
Smart contracts can be written in another languages like Vyper LLL , however Solidity is the most popular 

Solidity is statically typed , variable types need to be defined , unlike dymanic languages like JavaScript
Solidity is compiled (it has to be comiled 1st before we run the code) , it's not interpreted
extension of Solidity files is .sol
1 sol file can have several smart contracts

what is the typical layout? pragma contract variables functions...ect
State variables vs local variables - State variables are persisted on the blockchain after a smart contract finish to execute, whereas local variables live only during the execution of a function.
        contract A {
          //state variable
              uint a;

             //functions
             function foo() {
              uint b; //local variable
         }
        }
3 data types we used often - uint addres and string , 2 container types - array and mapping
How to declare a mapping of address to mapping of address to booleans (nested mapping)
     mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) a;
